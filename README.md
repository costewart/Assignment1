<h1>CPSC 436i: Assignment 1</h1>
<p> This webpage consists of three pages: About Me (the home page), Messages and Other Messages. In the Messages tab, you will find an input bar
where you can enter a message so it will appear in the message box as JSON data. Unfortunately, the erase all button is not functioning correctly on this page.
The Other Messages tab will lead you to an identical message page with the same input bar where you can enter a message. This message bar has bugs with the adding message functionality, however,
the erase all button works. The two pages were included to show the individual success of both tasks, however, I was unable to combine these to function on one page.</p>
